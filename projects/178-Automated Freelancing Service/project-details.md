#### How would you describe your project?
Discord server with a custom bot that manages freelancing orders. We will use Discord's brand new shiny slash commands.

1. `/ticket` will create your own ticket channel called `#ticket-yourname`
2. You will then select the service you want from the list and enter a description of what you need
3. Approved freelancers will be able to pick up your project and join the channel, ask for more info etc
4. The assigned freelancer will use `/invoice <amount>` to request TNB payment from you (to an escrow wallet for new freelancers or directly to the freelancer's wallet for established freelancers)
5. The `#ticket-yourname` channel will live as long as needed, until a the freelancer uses `/close` (we will keep old channels for 7 days)
