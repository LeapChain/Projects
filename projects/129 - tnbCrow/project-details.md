This platform can be a bridge between buyers and sellers. There will be a spike in the number of people wanting to buy TNBC before it's officially released and this platform can work as an exchange for that period of time.

The application is well-scoped at the moment. Will need some when we start doing the backlogs.

To prevent scams from happening while people are buying/selling TNBC.

The more people exchange their TNBC, the more successful this project will be.
