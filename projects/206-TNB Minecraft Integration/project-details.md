#### What problem does this project solve?
Integrates TNB with the Minecraft community.

#### Who is the target market?
Minecraft players and those in the TNB community who play Minecraft.

#### How will this project benefit the network and/or the community?
It'll expose people to TNB. Say you've never heard ot TNB and you're tipped some- now you're a TNB holder.

An important part of this is that TNB promotes the Minecraft server that will be running this because Minecraft players who receive TNB have questions that other people can answer- and get them hooked.
