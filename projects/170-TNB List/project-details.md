#### How would you describe your project?
An application where users can trade various things/services in exchange for TNBC. Basically a craiglist that uses just TNBC and is focused on TNB members. It can also act as a site where people can hire freelancers for TNBC.

#### What problem does this project solve?
More people can get their hands on TNBC, rather than just developers/designers. Anybody with any skill can post it on the application and get hired/paid by anybody on the community.

#### Who is the target market?
Anybody interested in TNBC and wants to earn coins with their skills.

#### How will this project benefit the network and/or the community?
It has a huge oppurtunity of bring more people involved in the community once the beta is reached. Anybody with any skill can post it on the application and get hired/paid by anybody on the community. This would mean, the community would not be restricted to just developer and designers

#### How is this project centered around thenewboston?
Users would trade using TNBC for the products/services. We would be using KeySign for the transactions.
