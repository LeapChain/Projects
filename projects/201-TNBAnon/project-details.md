#### How would you describe your project?
TNBAnon will be an app that allows people to send coins anonymously.
With this app you will be able to make a transaction with someone, without letting him know what your wallet address is.

After the anonymous send feature (which is the core of TNBAnon) is successfully built, TNBAnon will expand itself by adding another feature and becoming a privacy centered wallet which allows to send/spend coins anonymously.

#### What problem does this project solve?
all the network info including balance and transaction history is public, so if you send coins to someone, they'll know your wallet address and will have access to its info
TNBAnon will allow you to send them coins without revealing your wallet address

#### Who is the target market?
everyone who owns TNBC and is concerned about their privacy

#### How will this project benefit the network and/or the community?
it will allow community members to send coins anonymously

#### How is this project centered around thenewboston?
it is all about TNBC, so it is fully centered around thenewboston

#### What is the estimated completion date for this project? (rough estimates are acceptable)
may take from 3 weeks to 2 months

# Milestone Details

#### Milestone Description
First milestone will have 2 main objectives:

Objective 1: designing and creating the core logic which the app will use to function under the hood, this is where I will be figuring out the techniques for making anonymous transactions on a public block-chain and organizing/implementing/modeling them in a way that allows them to be coded.

Objective 2: is where I will be converting the core logic from Objective 1 into code and providing a fully tested and working python script with a basic UI that allows to send coins anonymously from one wallet to another.
The script from Objective 2 will act as a POC for the app.
