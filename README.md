## Overview

This repository is for project proposals for thenewboston digital currency. Funding will be provided for all projects 
or apps that adhere to the [Rules & Guidelines](https://thenewboston.com/projects/rules).

**Note**: The Idea Only proposals will receive 3000 coins as a reward after the first weekly report received from the 
team which is executing that Idea.

**More info**: https://thenewboston.com/projects/overview

## How to Submit a Proposal

#### There are two types of proposals:

- **Project Proposal**: Where the person giving an idea is ready to work on that project. [Click here](https://github.com/thenewboston-developers/Project-Proposals/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Project&template=add-project-proposal.md&title=NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT) to submit Project Proposal

- **Idea Only Proposal**: Where the person has an idea but not ready to work on it and wants someone else to take that 
  idea and build the project. [Click here](https://github.com/thenewboston-developers/Project-Proposals/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Idea+Only&template=idea-only-proposal.md&title=NAME_OF_YOUR_IDEA) to submit Idea Only Proposal.

Please fill out all required fields. Feel free to include any additional information as well!

## What Next

The team will review your proposal within 2-3 days. Please check back often as there may be additional questions from 
the team on your proposal. If approved the proposal will be labeled **Pending Repository**. You will be required to 
leave a comment with the URL of the project repository before final approval.

After repository URL has been submitted, the proposal will be labeled **Approved** and final terms will be merged into 
this repository.

## Build a Team

As project manager, you can choose to submit either an individual or team project proposal. If your project requires a 
team of contributors then you will be responsible for choosing your own team. If you would like help with recruiting 
for any positions whether it is designers, developers, quality analysts, etc... please post the role you are looking for 
in the **#recruiting** channel on Slack and our team will help you find a contributor.

After the **team formation**, the team leader (or manager) has to provide details of each member of the team. Details 
**include Full Name, GitHub Username, Slack username, LinkedIn, Role in the team, and the account number** where they 
want to receive payments.
