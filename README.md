## Overview

Contributors can earn coins by working on apps, games, tools, and other software for thenewboston network. To receive 
funding, project proposals will be submitted to thenewboston team who will review the details of the proposal to ensure 
that all rules and guidelines are met. Once approved, coins will be rewarded as milestones are completed throughout the 
development process.

These projects will improve our network through the continuous creation of new apps, games, and tools while also 
allowing for a more widespread distribution of coins to many contributors.
